================================================
DO NO MAKE ANY CHANGES IN OTHER FILES!!!
==============================================
BEFORE STARTING, READ PROJECT'S INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY.
by project's instructions I mean instruction in Claude, not in readme.md or any other file in repo
-----------
do your job in small steps, after each step make pause and wait for my 'go'
-----------
**Problem:** I need to create static method witch will migrate content of .ts files in my angular ver 20 application to usage of signals

=================
start to implement a method metaheuristic.java_version_migration.migrations.AngularToSignalMigration.migrateAngularToSignalMigration
and creating unit-tests in metaheuristic.java_version_migration.migrations.AngularToSignalMigration.migrateAngularToSignalMigrationTest
================
variable 'String content', which method migrateAngularToSignalMigration() will receive, will be always not null, no need in additional check.
================
as i understand, for better decision, this migration method must have access to other files in dir, specifically, .html, to understand what to migrate to signal.
use Map<String, String> files  in metaheuristic.java_version_migration.Migration.MigrationConfig for accessing required files
=============

this is a continue of coding of this method and tests, so check the current implementation of method/tests and make needed adjustments
=============

also, there are 2 files (.ts and .html) which i want to migrate to signal by using this method, but right now nothing was changed when I run migrateAngularToSignalMigrationTest()

============
when you run tests in maven, run test one-by-one. don't run all tests in AngularToSignalMigration at the same time


tests which are failing at this moment:

migrateAngularToSignalMigrationTest_mixedSignalAndNonSignal()
migrateAngularToSignalMigrationTest_realWorldAngularComponent()
migrateAngularToSignalMigrationTest_propertyBinding()
migrateAngularToSignalMigrationTest_eventHandlers()
